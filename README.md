# Prioritisation Framework for Volcanic Fields

This project is the publicly available form of the code used in my Honours thesis at Monash University. Using the Central Highlands subprovince of the Newer Volcanics Province (Australia), the code walks the reader through how to calculate priority rankings for eruptive centres in volcanic fields. This code uses components of risk - hazard, exposure, vulnerability and frequency - to guide future research in the Central Highlands.

## ðŸŒ‹ About Me
I'm an Honours student studying Geology at Monash University, Australia. I'm interested in unravelling the complexity of volcanic processes, as well as understanding their impacts on nearby communities.
